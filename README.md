## Warning

- ⚠️ I am not affiliated with the Ho Chi Minh City University of Law in any way. Please consider this project as a personal project.
- ⚠️ I cannot guarantee proper translation of the schedule. Please check the schedule carefully before using it.
- ⚠️ Because the tool expects **Unicode** to be the input's encoding, if you notice missing characters, please check your input's encoding and manually replace the missing characters with their Unicode equivalent.
  - If you're using Unikey, make sure your _Character set_ or _Bảng mã_ is set to **Unicode** when you replace the missing characters. See [Character sets](https://www.unikey.org/support/ukmanual.html#charsets) for more information. Also see [Unikey Toolkit](https://www.unikey.org/support/ukmanual.html#uktoolkit) for bulk replacement.
